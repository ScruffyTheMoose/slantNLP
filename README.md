Project on hold for the moment while I deal with some school things! Will be back to work soon.

Contains modules for sentiment analysis and databasing of Reddit/Twitter submissions

The processor module contains a functioning set of methods for cleaning and analyzing a body of text that will return a dataframe of assessed sentiment using NLTK, spaCy, and VADER.

The other modules currently in this repo are placeholders from a separate project that will need some changes to be functional for databasing and operating on sentiment related data.
