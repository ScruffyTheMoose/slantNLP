Progress is slow at the moment with school and other things but I am making updates when I have the time.

Contains modules for sentiment analysis and databasing of Reddit/Twitter submissions

The processor module contains a functioning set of methods for cleaning and analyzing a body of text that will return a dataframe of assessed sentiment using NLTK, spaCy, and VADER.

Other modules for working the database are being gradually built. These will be followed by the main module once the kinks are worked out.
